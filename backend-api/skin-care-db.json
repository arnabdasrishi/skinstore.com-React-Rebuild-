Turn on your device and toggle the appropriate button until all of the blue lights are illuminated (Trinity) or set to the far right (mini). This is the optimal microcurrent setting for everyone. Intensity can be adjusted for comfort at any time.\nStep 2: Apply your choice of NuFACE Gel Primer in a mask-like layer in sections as you treat, beginning with the cheek. Skin should appear wet, and you should feel little to no sensation from the device. Tip: Try applying a NuFACE serum under your Gel Primer like the PROs do!\nStep 3: Lift! Place both spheres on position one and glide to the lower ear until the beep sounds. You will hear the audible treatment timer beep every five seconds. Move to position two and glide. Move to position three and glide. Return to position one and repeat the facial lift treatment two more times. Next, apply the gel primer above the left brow. Place both spheres on position one and slowly glide to position one until the beep sounds. Move to position two and glide. Move to position three and glide. Return to position one and repeat the sequence two more times. Lift half of your face and compare the treated side of the face to the untreated side of the face, and look for skincare improvement in the brow, cheekbone, and jawline areas. Now apply the gel primer to the other side of the face and continue the facial-lift treatment as described above."
